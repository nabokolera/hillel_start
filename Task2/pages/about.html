   <h1>About me</h1> 
   <p>
I am a Recruiter with 2-year experience in IT. During this time, I was one of the key specialists in a team of 30+
people. <br>
I am a quick learner, used to working under pressure and in a fast- paced environment.<br>
Now I want to bring my
skills to a new company - apply my previous experience, learn from a new team of professionals and grow as a specialist.
